   <p title="Rush2112">Network designers usually think about networks as seven distinct network architecture components when they design networks. Figure 6-1 shows a typical network for a large enterprise. This
organization has three enterprise campuses in different cities that are connected by a WAN provided by a common carrier such as AT&T. Each campus has several buildings that are connected
by a backbone network.</p>
  <p title="Rush2112">
    The first network architecture component is the local area network (LAN), which enables
users to access the network. Some vendors call this component the access layer because it provides access to the network. Chapter 7 describes LANs, both wired and wireless, because when
we build LANs today, we usually provide both wired and wireless access. The technologies we use
in the LAN are probably familiar to you because you have used them, and perhaps you have even
installed them in your home or apartment: They are network hubs, switches, and wireless access
points.
  </p>
  <p title="Rush2112">
    The second network architecture component is the building backbone network, which some
vendors call the distribution layer, because it distributes network traffic to and from the LANs.
The building backbone typically uses the same basic technology that we use in the LAN (a network
switch), but usually we buy faster switches because the building backbone carries more network
traffic than a LAN. Chapter 8 describes building backbones.
  </p>
  <p>
    The third network architecture component is the campus backbone (sometimes called the
core layer), which connects all the buildings on one campus. The campus backbone is usually
faster than the backbones we use inside buildings because it typically carries more traffic than
they do. We use routers or layer 3 switches that do routing when we design the campus backbone.
Chapter 8 also describes campus backbones.
